# Super Iter

  Take the best ideas from python's itertools, mochikit iter, ramdas currying, and all the lovely ES6 iterable protocols and what do you get?

  Super Iteration...



## Install

  ```
  npm install @ibrokethat/super-iter

  ```


##  Usage

  ```
  import {ifilter, imap, sum, takeWhile} from 'super-iter';

  let a1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let a2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
  let a3 = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

  let sumAll = imap((...args) => sum(args));
  let evens = ifilter(v => v%2 === 0);
  let less250 = takeWhile(v => v < 250);

  let v = less250(evens(sumAll(a1, a2, a3)));

  console.log(v); // -> [222]

  ```

## Test

  ```
  git clone git@github.com/ibrokethat/super-iter
  cd super-iter
  npm i
  npm test
  ```

## Todo


  - Move build and test commands into .bin as they are getting too verbose to fit package.json nicely.
  - Have the tests trigger the builds
  - Add githooks to trigger tests pre commit
  - build for browserify
